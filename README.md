# ProjectOne
This is where we will analyze 2001 Census data from India


## Questions we may ask

* literacy level / percent literacy
* Growth rate
* Religious population / percentage
* Drinking water vs paved roads
* Religion vs amenities - is there some sort of discrimination?
* Permanent vs temporary housing vs literacy
* Age/literacy vs amenities



Jake Clifton - Growth Rate - How does the infrastructure impact the growth rate? 

Laura Bullard - Which religion is most common in each district? How are they distributed throughout India? 

Brandon Damore - Age/literacy vs amenities in each district. Is there a correlation between the two?

Matt O'Connor - Effect of rural areas on education
