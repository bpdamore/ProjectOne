# ProjectOne

The dataset that we have chosen is 2001 Census Data from India. There is a large amount of data for each district, and each state in India, and we think that we can make some pretty cool observations. 

You can access that dataset [here](Resources/all.csv).


## What are some questions we can ask?

* Growth rate
* Religious population / percentage
* Drinking water vs paved roads
* Religion vs amenities - is there some sort of discrimination?
* Permanent vs temporary housing vs literacy
* Literacy vs amenities

## What are we trying to find out?

Jake Clifton - Growth Rate - How does the infrastructure impact the growth rate? 

Laura Bullard - Which religion is most common in each district? How are they distributed throughout India? 

Brandon Damore - Literacy vs amenities in each district. Do more literate areas have more access to amenities than less literate ones?

Matt O'Connor - Effect of rural areas on education

Kevin Eugene - 

## How will we answer our questions?

As you can see above, we have split the questions up between the members of our group. Each person is tasked with consolidating the relevant data, cleaning/formatting the data, and analyzing the data. The data will be cleaned individually due to the size of the overall data, and because of the inconsistency of missing values.

After each person has a base analysis, they will create graphs to represent the data that they have cleaned. Using those graphs and the analysis from before, each member will come to a conclusion and answer the question they have chosen.
